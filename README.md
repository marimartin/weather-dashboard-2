Weather Dasboard

This application allows the user to search for the weather outlook of any city. When they search for the city they are presented with both current weather details as well as a five-day forecast. During their session, they are also able to look back through cities that they have already looked up by clicking on buttons that are generated after each search. When the page is reloaded, the last city they searched will have its weather outlook presented.
